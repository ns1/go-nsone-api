## 2.7.0 (October 25, 2022)
NOTES:
Previously, when updating monitoring jobs, if the `Rules` field
in the request was empty, it was silently removed from the API
call, making it effectively a no-op. As of version 2.7.0, specifying
an empty `Rules` field on a monitoring job update will delete all
rules from the job. Before upgrading to this version, users are advised
to check their monitoring job code for use of the `Rules` field to make
sure it will not accidentally delete rules.

FEATURES:
* Adds support for DNS views. See new section in README.md for details.
* Adds support for `OtherNetworks` secondary zone attribute.
* Adds support for deleting monitoring job rules.

BUG FIXES:
* Adjusted license file to be recognizable by automated parsers.
* Fixed handling of "Zone already exists" error.
* QPS function fixes.
